    Dummy class to be extended by classes acting as modes.

    In-game interaction is modal: when a client sends a line, the resulting behavior will be different depending on what's going on. The user may be logging in, or sending an ordinary command, or responding to a prompt.

    Mode classes should override the handle() method, which the protocol will call on the active mode when a line is received from the client.
